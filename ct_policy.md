# Certificate Transparency in Chrome
_Questions: [ct-policy@chromium.org](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/ct-policy)_

This document details the criteria for a certificate to be considered
*CT Qualified*.

Google Chrome requires that all Extended Validation (EV) certificates
issued after 1 Jan 2015 be CT Qualified in order to be recognized as EV,
and that all publicly-trusted TLS certificates issued after 30 April 2018
be CT Qualified in order to be recognized as valid.

In addition, Google Chrome allows for site operators to indicate that they
expect all publicly-trusted certificates for their domain, regardless of when
they were issued, be CT Qualified in order to be trusted.

Chrome’s current Certificate Transparency implementation is as follows:

  1. Google runs three geographically diverse CT logs which accept all
     certificates issued by CAs accepted by any major browser.
  1. Google continues to invite other organisations to deploy CT logs in order
     to improve robustness.
  1. On 1 Jan 2015 Chrome created a whitelist of certificates that contained
     EV policy OIDs included or pending inclusion in Chrome, that were logged
     in a qualifying log, and that would not qualify via SCTs embedded in the
     certificate (see below).
  1. In March 2015 Chrome for desktop platforms ceased to show the EV
     indicator for certificates not in the whitelist and not CT qualified
     according to the criteria below.

## Qualifying Logs

The criteria for qualifying logs can be found [here](log_policy.md).

## Qualifying Certificate

A certificate is “CT qualified” if it meets one of the following criteria:

  1. An SCT from a log qualified at the time of check is presented via the TLS
     extension OR is embedded within a stapled OCSP response;
 
     **AND** there is at least one SCT from a Google Log, qualified at the time
     of check, presented via any method;

     **AND** there is at least one SCT from a non-Google Log, qualified at time
     of check, presented via any method.
  1. An Embedded SCT from a log qualified at the time of check is presented;

     **AND** there is at least one Embedded SCT from a Google Log, once or
     currently qualified;

     **AND** there is at least one Embedded SCT from a non-Google Log, once or
     currently qualified;

     **AND** there are Embedded SCTs from AT LEAST the number of logs once or
     currently qualified shown in Table 1.

"Once or currently qualified" means that the log was qualified or pending
qualification at the time of certificate issuance, that the log was accepted
prior to the time of check, but that the log may have been disqualified
following acceptance, prior to the time of check.

"Embedded SCT" means an SCT delivered via an X.509v3 extension within the
certificate.

**Table 1**

| Lifetime of Certificate | Number of SCTs from distinct logs |
|:---:|:---:|
| < 15 months | 2 |
| >= 15, <= 27 months | 3 |
| > 27, <= 39 months | 4<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> |
| > 39 months | 5 |

<a name="footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> EV certificates should never have a
lifetime over 27 months.

Note that, so long as one of the above conditions is met by some combination
of SCTs presented in the handshake, additional SCTs, regardless of the status
of the SCT, will not affect the CT Qualification status positively or
negatively.

**Important note: many TLS servers do not support OCSP Stapling or the TLS
extension, so CAs should be prepared to insert SCTs into issued EV
certificates to maintain the EV indication.**

## Timeouts

The list of qualifying and once qualifying logs will be periodically refreshed
during regular Chrome releases. If the installed version of Chrome has not
applied security updates for a significant amount of time then CT checking
will be disabled.
